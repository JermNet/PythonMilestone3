# THOUGHT PROCESS
This is a project done for my self study course, in which I decided to learn Python! We have to do 4 milestones, and this is the third! The last one was graphical, and the next will be too, but both are largely different from this. One of my main goals is to use different Python modules, and I've used three different graphical libraries for my three different graphical programs!
